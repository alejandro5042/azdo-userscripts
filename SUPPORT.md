# Getting Help

This userscript is maintained for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge with the Violentmonkey extension on Mac & Windows. They may work with other setups (e.g. with TamperMonkey) but we do not guarantee it.

## Troubleshooting

- Have you tried refreshing the page?
- Are you on the latest version?
  - [Check the latest release number](https://github.com/alejandro5042/azdo-userscripts/releases)
  - See what version you have installed from the Violentmonkey dashboard
    - If you see an red error bar at the bottom of your page, it should have the version number
  - If you're out-of-date, update your userscript and then hit refresh, or uninstall/reinstall the userscript
- Are there are any interesting errors in the JavaScript console?
  - [Documentation for most major browsers](https://kb.yoast.com/kb/how-to-find-javascript-errors-with-your-browsers-console/)
  - If you see an red error bar at the bottom of your page, it should have a "Copy Details" butotn that does this for you
- Are you using [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)? If not, please use that
- Does it work in another browser?
- Does it work in the other Azure DevOps URL scheme?
  - dev.azure.com/mystuff vs. mystuff.visualstudio.com
- Have you disabled ad blockers / content blockers on Azure DevOps? Sometimes these don't play well; besides there are no ads on AzDO anyway

If you have not yet resolved the issue or if you believe there is a bigger underlying issue, please report it.
